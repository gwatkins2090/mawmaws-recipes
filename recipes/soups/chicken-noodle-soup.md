This homemade chicken noodle soup is pure comfort in a bowl. Made from scratch with a whole chicken, it creates the most flavorful broth that's perfect for cold days or when you're feeling under the weather.

## The Healing Power of Soup

There's science behind why chicken soup makes you feel better - the warm broth helps with hydration, the steam can ease congestion, and the nutrients support recovery.

## Tips for the Best Soup

- **Homemade broth**: Using a whole chicken creates incredible depth of flavor
- **Fresh vegetables**: Don't skip the aromatics - they build the flavor base
- **Proper seasoning**: Taste and adjust salt and pepper at the end
- **Fresh herbs**: Parsley adds brightness and color

## Make-Ahead Tips

- Make the broth and chicken ahead of time
- Cook noodles separately and add when serving to prevent mushiness
- Freezes well without the noodles for up to 3 months
