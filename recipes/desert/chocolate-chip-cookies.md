These chocolate chip cookies are the gold standard - crispy edges, chewy centers, and packed with chocolate chips in every bite. They're perfect for any occasion and always disappear quickly!

## The Science of Perfect Cookies

The combination of granulated and brown sugar creates the perfect texture - granulated sugar helps with spread and crispiness, while brown sugar adds moisture and chewiness.

## Pro Baking Tips

- **Room temperature butter**: Should give slightly when pressed
- **Don't overmix**: Mix just until flour disappears
- **Uniform size**: Use a cookie scoop for even baking
- **Parchment paper**: Prevents sticking and promotes even browning

## Troubleshooting

- **Cookies spread too much**: Chill the dough or use less butter
- **Cookies too thick**: Press dough balls slightly before baking
- **Cookies too hard**: Don't overbake, remove when edges are just set
