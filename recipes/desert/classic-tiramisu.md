This authentic tiramisu recipe creates the perfect balance of coffee, cream, and sweetness. The key is using quality ingredients and allowing enough time for the flavors to meld together.

## The Art of Tiramisu

Tiramisu means "pick me up" in Italian, referring to the energizing combination of coffee and sugar. This dessert originated in the Veneto region and has become one of Italy's most beloved exports.

## Essential Tips

- **Quality mascarpone**: Use the best you can find - it makes a huge difference
- **Strong coffee**: Use espresso or very strong coffee for authentic flavor
- **Gentle folding**: Don't overmix the cream to maintain the light texture
- **Patience**: The overnight rest is crucial for proper texture and flavor

## Make-Ahead Perfection

Tiramisu actually improves with time, making it perfect for entertaining. It can be made up to 2 days ahead and tastes even better the next day.
