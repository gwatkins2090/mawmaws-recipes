This is the real deal - authentic Roman carbonara that's been perfected over generations. No cream, no garlic, no peas - just eggs, cheese, pancetta, and pasta water creating magic.

## The Secret to Perfect Carbonara

The technique is everything in carbonara. The hot pasta and starchy cooking water cook the eggs gently, creating a silky, creamy sauce without scrambling.

## Traditional Tips from Nonna

- **Quality ingredients**: Use the best pancetta or guanciale you can find
- **Fresh cheese**: Grate your own Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano
- **Timing**: Have everything ready before you start - this dish comes together quickly
- **Temperature**: The pasta should be very hot when you add the egg mixture

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Adding cream (never!)
- Using pre-grated cheese
- Letting the eggs scramble
- Not using enough pasta water
- Adding garlic (not traditional)
