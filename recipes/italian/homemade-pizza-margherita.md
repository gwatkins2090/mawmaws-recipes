Nothing beats the simplicity and perfection of a classic Pizza Margherita. With just a few quality ingredients, you can create restaurant-quality pizza at home.

## The Art of Pizza Making

Pizza Margherita was created in 1889 to honor Queen Margherita of Savoy, featuring the colors of the Italian flag: red tomatoes, white mozzarella, and green basil.

## Tips for Perfect Pizza

- **High heat**: The hotter your oven, the better your pizza
- **Thin sauce**: Less is more - you want to taste the dough and cheese
- **Quality mozzarella**: Fresh mozzarella makes all the difference
- **Fresh basil**: Add after baking to preserve the bright flavor

## Equipment Tips

- Pizza stone or steel for crispy crust
- Pizza peel for easy transfer
- Kitchen scale for consistent dough
- Stand mixer with dough hook (optional but helpful)
