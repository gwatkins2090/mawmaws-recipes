These chicken tacos capture all the flavors of traditional al pastor with a slightly easier preparation. The combination of smoky chiles, sweet pineapple, and tender chicken is irresistible.

## The Story of Al Pastor

Al pastor originated from Lebanese immigrants to Mexico who adapted their shawarma technique using local ingredients like chiles and pineapple.

## Authentic Touches

- **Chile blend**: The combination of guajillo and ancho chiles creates the signature flavor
- **Pineapple**: Essential for authentic al pastor flavor
- **Corn tortillas**: Always use corn for street-style tacos
- **Simple toppings**: Let the marinated meat be the star
