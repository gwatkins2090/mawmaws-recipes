These pancakes have been a family favorite for over 50 years. Grandma Rose always said the secret was in the buttermilk and not overmixing the batter. The result is incredibly light and fluffy pancakes that are perfect for weekend mornings or special occasions.

## The Story Behind the Recipe

This recipe came from my grandmother Rose, who learned it from her mother during the Great Depression. Back then, buttermilk was often available when fresh milk wasn't, and these pancakes became a way to create something special from simple ingredients.

## Tips for Perfect Pancakes

- **Temperature matters**: Your griddle should be hot enough that a drop of water sizzles and evaporates quickly
- **Don't press down**: Let the pancakes cook naturally without pressing them with a spatula
- **Fresh baking powder**: Make sure your baking powder is fresh for maximum fluffiness
- **Room temperature ingredients**: Take eggs and buttermilk out 30 minutes before cooking for best results

## Serving Suggestions

These pancakes are delicious with:

- Pure maple syrup and butter
- Fresh berries and whipped cream
- Honey and chopped nuts
- Apple cinnamon compote
- Crispy bacon or sausage on the side
