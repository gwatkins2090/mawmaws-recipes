This classic beef stir fry is all about high heat, quick cooking, and fresh ingredients. The key is having everything prepped and ready to go before you start cooking.

## Stir Fry Success Tips

- **Prep everything first**: Stir frying happens fast, so have all ingredients cut and sauces mixed
- **High heat**: Your pan should be smoking hot for proper searing
- **Don't overcrowd**: Cook in batches if necessary
- **Keep it moving**: Constant stirring prevents burning

## The Perfect Sauce

The combination of soy sauce and oyster sauce creates the classic stir fry flavor, while cornstarch helps thicken the sauce and coat the ingredients.

## Serving Suggestions

- Serve over steamed jasmine rice
- Try with brown rice for extra nutrition
- Garnish with sesame seeds
- Add a squeeze of lime for brightness
